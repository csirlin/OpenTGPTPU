Testing the duration of MMC operations.
The goal is to figure out when it's safe to switch weights as part of the new fifo queue and weight selection system

MMC operations are expected to take L + 2N cycles, where 
- L = number of accumulator rows to fill
- N = width/height of the matrix

There are 4 testcases:
- 8x8 matrix, only output 4 rows
  - python ../runtpu.py duration_8x8_4.out hm_8x8.npy w_8x8.npy > 8x8_4.txt
  - should take 4 + 2*8 = 20 cycles
  - success, accumulator last changes in cycle 120 per 8x8_4.txt

- 8x8 matrix, multiply all 8 rows
  - python ../runtpu.py duration_8x8_8.out hm_8x8.npy w_8x8.npy > 8x8_8.txt
  - should take 8 + 2*8 = 24 cycles
  - success, accumulator last changes in cycle 124 per 8x8_8.txt

- 16x16 matrix, only output 8 rows
  - python ../runtpu.py duration_16x16_8.out hm_16x16.npy w_16x16.npy > 16x16_8.txt
  - should take 8 + 2*16 = 40 cycles
  - success, accumulator last changes in cycle 140 per 16x16_8.txt

- 16x16 matrix, multiply all 16 rows
  - python ../runtpu.py duration_16x16_16.out hm_16x16.npy w_16x16.npy > 16x16_16.txt
  - should take 16 + 2*16 = 48 cycles
  - success, accumulator last changes in cycle 148 per 16x16_16.txt

So we can probably switch the weights in the following cycle (issue + L + 2N + 1).
