Mullifier Unit Tests will test for special mullifier capabilities, as described
and numbered below.

A nop and regular version will exist of each test.

ACT instruction
    Branch
        1. Branch forward using value in res[0][0]
        2. Branch backward using value in res[0][0]
        3. Branch forward using value in res[0][1]
        4. Branch backward using value in res[0][1]
    Equality check
        5. Equal to 0
        6. Not equal to 0
    Less than check
        7. Less than 0
