Testing functionality of RW instructions.
Load different weight matrices up to and past the 4-weight capacity of the buffer

test_rhm.py outputs initial configuration for the weights and host memory
test_rhm.a contains the instructions for the test
expected_output.txt contains the expected results of running the pyrtl sim 

Running the test (assuming test_rw is your current directory):
python test_rw.py
python ../../assembler.py test_rw.a
python ../../{runtpu|sim}.py test_rw.out input.npy weights.npy
