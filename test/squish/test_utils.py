# utilities for running squish tests

# run a squish test with chosen bitwidth and matsize for different distances. 
# start from 50 and reduce until the test doesn't match the control, or a distance of 1 is reached successfully.
# return the lowest distance that was successful

# find the mimimum viable distance for a variety of bitwidths and matsizes
