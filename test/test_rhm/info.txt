Testing functionality of RHM and WHM instructions.
Combos of RHM (host memory to unified buffer) and WHM (unified buffer to host memory) of different sizes

test_rhm.py outputs initial configuration for the weights and host memory
test_rhm.a contains the instructions for the test
expected_output.txt contains the expected results of running the pyrtl sim 

Running the test (assuming test_rhm is your current directory):
python test_rhm.py
python ../../assembler.py test_rhm.a
python ../../{runtpu|sim}.py test_rhm.out input.npy weights.npy
